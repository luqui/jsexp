For CodeCatalog, we want our code editing experience to be badass. As in,
automatically detecting dependencies, contextual autocompleting, syntax
checking, ...  That means we have to parse and *understand* (that is, actually
build a syntax tree) for the code as you are editing it.  Traditional parsing
frameworks are not great at handling partially-complete input. Thus *jsexp*.
